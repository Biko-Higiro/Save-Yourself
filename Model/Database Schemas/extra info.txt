4 ranges for each. which will affect the feedback and plans


Normalization checks

1nf: No order for row information, no mixing datatypes in a single column, every table must have a primary key, each cell has a single value.
2nf: All non-key attributes must depend on the entirety of a primary key. (check if an attribute of a composite key, needs its own column)
3nf: no transitive dependencies.
4nf: all multivalued dependencies must be only on the key. (if a attribute has a set of possible values, make sure that that attribute is the only primary key).
5nf: a table which is in 4nf cannot be describable as the logical result of joining some other tables.
